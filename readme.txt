RESTRICTION AREA CREATION
Installion Guide :
Install this plugin
Create a/many restriction folder/folders in the wp-content directory
Put the .htaccess file into the folders in order to make them restricted.

important:

After installing all the visitors and users including admin will be restricted to access the files of that restricted folders.
TO remove restriction go to "ALL USERS" submenu under "USERS" menu.
Look at the table and there should be a column to remove restriction.
Just simply select NO to remove restriction and the ajax will do everything for you.

Most Imptortant:
The folders must be in wp-content directory or any subdirecotory under wp-content.


POSTS AND PAGE RESTRICTION:
There is a metabox which shows all the users of your site
Just put a check mark if you want to restrict that post or page from that user

Most Important: You have to put a shortcode inside the post or page you want to restrict
the shortcode is "[wprestriction]"
If the shortcode is inserted,the post is restricted from the visitors and admin defined users.
see the screenshots for better understanding


Now go to Wp restriction menu under settings menu. A short description is given how to populate that page
Simply put the messages to show instead of the restricted post.
There are two sections- one is for visitors and another is for users. You can set separate messages for them or put same message.
